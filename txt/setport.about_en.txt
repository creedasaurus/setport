BIO:
Creed Haymond is a programmer out of Provo, Utah.
He likes to eat well-made burgers and french fries as often as his doctor will 
allow. Coding since he first discovered it in 2011, he has been seeking 
to build the ultimate fighting robot. 

COMPANY:
Stoopclub is the brainchild of some bored college students who decided it'd be 
fun to hang out on the stoop of their apartment clomplex, listen to jazz,
and drink delicious cold beverages while shootin' the breeze. Since, it has
grown into a conglomerate of clever thinkers who have created small apps and 
dreams.

FOUNDING:
Summer of 2015 :: On the stoop
